# Model file

This folder will host all **classes** and **function** files that I'll be using throughout the project.

i believe we saw something similar in **SOLID File structure - Clean Architecture** file management system.
We can review it and decied on the final look and design of the file,

- final decision will be made after some reasearch and deeper considiration of the better file managment system/methodology.
- for the time being.
